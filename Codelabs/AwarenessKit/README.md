## Overview

```
The sample code shows how to use the Capture API and Barrier API of HUAWEI Awareness Kit for quick integration.
```

## Getting Started

    1. Register as a developer.
    Register a [HUAWEI account](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/).
    2. Create an app.
    Create an app and enable APIs.
    3. Build the demo.
    To build this demo, please first import the demo to Android Studio (3.X or later). Then download the agconnect-services.json file of the app from AppGallery Connect, and add the file to the app directory (\app) of the demo. For details, please refer to [Preparations for Integrating HUAWEI HMS Core](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/codelab/HMSPreparation/index.html)

## Running Environment

```
Android Studio and JDK 1.8 are used for coding.

To run the app generated by the sample code on a mobile phone, you need to use a mobile phone meeting the following requirements: the EMUI version is 9.1 or later or the Magic UI version is 2.1 or later; the chip version is Kirin 810, Kirin 980, Kirin 990, or later.
```

## Sample Code

```
The HUAWEI Awareness Kit sample code includes Capture and Barrier API sample code.

Capabilities called by the Capture API are as follows:

1. getTimeCategories(): The getTimeCategories() API requires the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission. This API can be used to obtain the semantic information about the current time of the user location.

2. getHeadsetStatus(): The getHeadsetStatus() API is used to obtain the headset connection status.

Capabilities called by the Barrier API are as follows:

1. HeadsetBarrier.connecting(): The HeadsetBarrier.connecting() API is used to create a headset barrier. When a headset is connected, the barrier status changes to true for about 5 seconds.

2. BehaviorBarrier.keeping(): The BehaviorBarrier.keeping() API requires the activity recognition permission ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION. This API is used to create an activity recognition barrier. When a user is in a specified activity state, the barrier status changes to true.

3. AwarenessBarrier.and(): The AwarenessBarrier.and() API is used to combine multiple barriers and perform the AND logic operation on barrier status to obtain the status of the combination barrier.

## Introduction

HUAWEI HiAI is an open artificial intelligence (AI) capability platform for smart devices, which adopts a "chip-device-cloud" architecture, opening up chip, app, and service capabilities for a fully intelligent ecosystem. This assists developers in delivering an optimal smart app experience for users, by fully leveraging Huawei's powerful AI processing capabilities.
In order to open up app capabilities, HUAWEI HiAI Engine provides a wide range of AI capabilities that can be integrated into apps. Two AI capabilities were used in this demo:

* Document Skew Correction: This API automatically identifies document positions and adjusts document angles in an image.

* General Text Recognition: Extract the text information in the picture for subsequent processing.

## Introduction

HUAWEI HiAI is an open artificial intelligence (AI) capability platform for smart devices, which adopts a "chip-device-cloud" architecture, opening up chip, app, and service capabilities for a fully intelligent ecosystem. This assists developers in delivering an optimal smart app experience for users, by fully leveraging Huawei's powerful AI processing capabilities.
In order to open up app capabilities, HUAWEI HiAI Engine provides a wide range of AI capabilities that can be integrated into apps. The Pose Estimation API were used in this demo:

* This API detects 14 key features of human bodies in images, and feeds back coordinate information of such features, including information of key skeletal features such as head, neck, left and right shoulders, as well as left and right elbows.
